# Mech-DLK SDK is OUT now! üéâ
Welcome! Fellow developers! üëã

Our Mech-DLK SDK is at your disposal NOW! Go develop your own programs.
## What's Mech-DLK SDK
Mech-DLK SDK is a secondary development software kit specifically designed to be used with Mech-DLK. Its main purpose is to help you easily do deep learning inference in your software systems. With Mech-DLK SDK, you can rapidly deploy deep learning models and flexibly integrate deep learning functionality into your own applications without reliance on Mech-Vision. Currently, development in C language is supported.

If you have any questions or have anything to share regarding our SDK, feel free to post on [Mech-Mind Online Community](https://community.mech-mind.com/).

## How to install Mech-DLK SDK

1. Create a local project folder on your device, say, ‚Äúdlk_sdk‚Äù.

2. Clone the repository of [Mech-DLK SDK](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk.git) to the created local project folder.

3. Download the third-party libraries (3rd_dll.zip) and resources (resources.zip) that Mech-DLK SDK relies on from [Downloads](https://downloads.mech-mind.com.cn/?tab=tab-dlk-sdk).

4. Unzip the downloaded packages of third-party libraries and resources and copy and paste the respective folders to the created project folder.

## C samples
The samples provided are in two categories: **Basic** and **Advanced**.

### üìå Basic
Samples using single models exported from Mech-DLK to do inference of single images, as well as samples used to obtain and visualize results.

- [Classification](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Basic/Classification.c): an inference sample of the Classification model.

- [DefectSegmentation](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Basic/DefectSegmentation.c): an inference sample of the Defect Segmentation model.

- [FastPositioning](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Basic/FastPositioning.c): an inference sample of the Fast Positioning model.

- [InstanceSegmentation](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Basic/InstanceSegmentation.c): an inference sample of the Instance Segmentation model.

- [ObjectDetection](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Basic/ObjectDetection.c): an inference sample of the Object Detection model.

### üìå Advanced
Samples for simultaneous inference of multiple images and inference of cascaded models.

- [CascadeModel](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Advanced/CascadeModel.c): an inference sample of cascaded models.

- [FolderImagesInfer](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Advanced/FolderImagesInfer.c): a sample used to show the inference of images in a folder one by one.

- [MultiImageInfer](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mechdlk_sdk/blob/main/samples/c/Advanced/MultiImageInfer.c): a sample of simultaneous inference of images.
